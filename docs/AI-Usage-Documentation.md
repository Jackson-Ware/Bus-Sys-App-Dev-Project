## Tasks Where AI Was Used

### 1. **Systems Architecture Diagram**
**What I Asked For:**
- Explanation of what a systems architecture diagram is
- Help understanding the requirements

**What AI Provided:**
- Conceptual explanation of architecture diagrams
- Guidance on components to include (frontend, backend, database)

**How I Used It:**
- Used the explanation to understand assignment requirements
- Created my own architecture diagram based on the guidance

**My Contribution:**
- Made decisions about technology stack
- Organized the diagram layout
- Applied it to my specific project context

---

### 2. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
**What I Asked For:**
- High-level overview of what an ERD is
- Explanation of how it supports user stories
- Help with relationship types (1:N, M:N)

**What AI Provided:**
- Definition of ERD and its purpose
- Explanation of relationship mappings
- Examples of how tables connect

**How I Used It:**
- Used the concepts to understand database design
- Applied relationship types to my 9 tables

**My Contribution:**
- Decided to hand-draw the ERD
- Determined which tables to include based on my features
- Wrote my own explanation of how schema supports user stories

---

### 3. **Architecture Decision Records (Technology Stack)**
**What I Asked For:**
- Help documenting why we chose specific technologies (React, .NET, Azure, GitHub)

**What AI Provided:**
- Structured format for documenting technology decisions
- Examples of justifications for each technology choice
- Industry context and statistics

**How I Used It:**
- Used the structure to organize my technology documentation
- Incorporated the reasoning into my own document

**My Contribution:**
- Selected which technologies to include
- Edited and personalized the justifications
- Organized the final document structure
- Made it specific to my project requirements

### 4. **Component Architecture (Atomic Design)**
**What I Asked For:**
- Explanation of Atomic Design principles
- Help creating component hierarchy for Product Catalog feature

**What AI Provided:**
- Definitions of Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates
- Example component hierarchy
- Visual structure diagram

**How I Used It:**
- Used the framework to organize my UI components
- Applied the definitions from my course materials

**My Contribution:**
- Simplified the structure to match assignment scope
- Incorporated definitions from my own class learnings
- Scoped components specifically to Product Catalog feature
- Created the final markdown document

---

### 5. **GitHub and Documentation Support**
**What I Asked For:**
- How to upload files to GitHub
- How to create markdown files
- How to structure documentation

**What AI Provided:**
- Step-by-step instructions for GitHub operations
- Markdown formatting guidance

**My Contribution:**
- Executed all GitHub operations myself
- Organized my repository structure
- Made decisions about file naming and placement

---

## AI-Generated vs. Student-Created Content

### **AI-Generated Content:**
- Initial drafts of documentation structure
- Examples and templates for architecture documents
- Explanations of technical concepts
- Formatting and markdown syntax

### **Student-Created Content:**
- All final decisions about project architecture
- Selection of technologies for my specific project
- Customization of all documents to fit my project
- All content review, editing, and validation
- Project-specific context and requirements
- Final document organization and submission

---

## Learning Outcomes

**What I Learned:**
- How to structure architecture documentation professionally
- Understanding of Atomic Design principles
- How database relationships support user stories
- Best practices for technology stack documentation
- GitHub workflow and markdown documentation

**How AI Helped My Learning:**
- Provided clear explanations when I was confused
- Offered examples that I could adapt
- Helped me understand industry-standard practices
- Saved time on formatting so I could focus on content

**What I Did Independently:**
- Made all architectural decisions
- Applied concepts to my specific project requirements
- Created hand-drawn ERD to ensure understanding
- Reviewed and validated all AI-generated content
- Organized and submitted all deliverables

## Ethical Use Statement

I used Claude as a learning assistant and documentation aid, similar to how I would use a textbook, tutorial, or office hours with a TA. All architectural decisions, technology choices, and final content were my own. I reviewed, understood, edited, and validated all AI-generated content before including it in my project. The AI served as a tool to help explain concepts and provide structure, but the intellectual work and decision-making were mine.
